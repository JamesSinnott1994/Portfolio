				<h1>Salutations!</h1>
				<p>I was born and raised in County Wexford in the South East of Ireland in 1994 A.D.</p>
				<p>I grew up with a great love of history and games, playing the likes of Rome Total War and Hearts of Iron. Games such as these are proof that individuals can learn a great deal through gaming, as not only do they teach you a lot about history but they also expand your knowledge of geography, all done while playing a fun game.</p>
				<p>I suppose it was my love of the above that encouraged me to take the Computer Games Development course in IT Carlow in 2012. It was a very interesting course that introduced me to the exciting world of computer programming.</p>
				<p>I graduated from IT Carlow in 2016. I worked for a number of years in a Civil Engineer's office, but now I am searching for a job in an IT company.</p>
				<p>I keep up-to-date with programming by taking various online courses. I'm only after finishing a Front-End Web Developer course on Treehouse, which was the main motivation for me building this portfolio website.</p>
				<p>In my spare time, I enjoy reading, driving, travelling, music and always learning new things.</p>
