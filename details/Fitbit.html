						<h1>Fitbit Prototype App</h1>
						<h3>Project Description:</h3>
						<p>This was the main project that I worked on for most of my internship at IT Carlow's GameCORE research facility. The project was about developing a "Fitbit" prototype app for Quantified Self in iOS. The purpose of this app was to increase user engagement with exercising by making a user compete against his/her previous self.</p>
						<p>I worked in a team of two initially, however after two months another person was brought into the team after my other work mate became sick and fell behind in work.</p>
						<p>We went through the SCRUM agile software development process for this project. The project was developed in JavaScript, HTML and CSS on the client side and Python on the server side, with MySQL being used to store data in databases. PhoneGap was the open source framework used for building the app in iOS.</p>
						<p>This project involved logging a user into the Fitbit app, and retrieving data from the Fitbit user using the Fitbit API, in this case the number of steps walked today and the number of steps walked this day last week. A fun-retro style race animation was used to give the user a clear idea of how they compared to their previous self, by displaying your previous self as a runner on a top track and your current self as a runner on a bottom track. There was also an achievements screen and a settings screen to log in/out and to enable/disable push notifications.</p>
